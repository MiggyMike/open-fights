### Overview

I've found a particular interest in Ruby on Rails as my first learned programming language, 2018/19. More recently, picking up JS and the React framework via General Assembly SEI cohort 10/2020-01/2021. Both, langauges I really have a great time working through and learning. Once I completed my cohort with GA, I knew at some point I wanted to see what and how I could use Rails backend and React on frontend.

After some searching, I came across this YouTube tutorial [Let's Build a CRUD app with Rails and React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqh9enFWHuY). So I gave it a shot here!

### Purpose

My main goal here was to get reacquainted with Ruby on Rails, as well as intergrating React for a 3week spring. Throughout this process, I documented the steps I took to revisit and attempt to build some thing later on down the line from my documented notes alone. I plan to do a few more sprints over the courese of the summer, to become a bit more accquainted with marrying the two languages.
